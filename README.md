Certainly! Hereâ€™s a detailed description for an AI software developer to build an internal business dashboard based on the provided image:

Title: Delivery Services â€“ Major Appliances UK

Purpose: To provide a comparative overview of delivery service options for major appliances within the UK sector, tailored for internal business analysis and decision-making.

Dashboard Components:

Header Section:

Title of the dashboard clearly displayed at the top.
Comparison Table:

Columns: The table should have columns for Price, Leadtime, Pick timeslot, Express, Evening, and Weekend delivery options.
Rows: Each row represents a different service level (Best in the market, Average, and a row for the company itself, labeled 'We are â€¦').
Icons and Text: Each row should have an icon indicating the level of service (trophy for 'Best', figures for 'Average', and a company logo for 'We are â€¦') followed by the text descriptions.
Service Level Details:

For each service level, provide the following details:
Price: Indicated as 'Free' for all service levels.
Leadtime: Specified in days (e.g., '1-3 days' for the best in the market, '2-5 days' for average, and '2-5 days' for the companyâ€™s service).
Pick timeslot: Availability of timeslot selection (e.g., '3-hour slot' for the best, 'Morning/Afternoon slots' for average, 'No' for the companyâ€™s service).
Delivery Options:

Boolean indicators (Yes/No) for each of the delivery options (Express, Evening, Weekend) across service levels.
Visual Indicators:

Colored backgrounds for the cells to indicate availability or absence (e.g., green for 'Yes', red for 'No').
Footer:

Date of the last update (e.g., '2/29/2024') at the bottom of the dashboard.
Styling:

Use a clean and professional design with legible fonts.
Employ a color scheme that reflects the brand identity of the company, such as the companyâ€™s color for the 'We are â€¦' row.
Ensure that icons and color indicators are intuitive and have tooltips on hover explaining what they signify.
Functionality:

The dashboard should be interactive where applicable, allowing users to hover over information for additional details.
It should be dynamic, capable of updating in real-time as delivery service data changes.
